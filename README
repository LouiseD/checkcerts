Introduction
-------------

checkcerts runs tests against certificates.
The tests can check aspects of a certificate's profile against requirements
or standards.

This software was developed based on a requirement from IGTF to check
compliance of CA certificates against the Grid Certificate Profile GFD-C.125.


Requirements
-------------

The software requires a number of perl packages which are widely available
with operating system distributions or from CPAN (cpan.org).

 * Getopt::Long
 * Pod::Usage
 * Test::Harness
 * Test::More
 * Crypt::OpenSSL::X509 (* but see NOTE below)

(* NOTE) The supplied test suite "gfd125-ca.t" makes use of an enhanced
version of Crypt::OpenSSL::X509 that has not yet been incorporated into the
distributed version. It can temporarily be downloaded from
https://www.cs.tcd.ie/David.OCallaghan/Crypt-OpenSSL-X509-0.9.1-TCD.tar.gz or a
bzr (http://bazaar-vcs.org/) branch can be pulled from
https://www.cs.tcd.ie/David.OCallaghan/crypt-openssl-x509/. 


Running
--------

For a brief usage guide run checkcerts.pl with no options. For a more detailed
manual run checkcerts.pl --man.

To try it out, run:

    ./checkcerts.pl -t gfd125-ca.t -c cacert.pem

You should expect to see 2 failures.

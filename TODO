Limitations:
- The tests don't check the contents of cert extensions, only their presence/absence and criticality.
- The tests for CA certs against GFD-C.125 are incomplete
- There are no tests specifically for EE certs
- The test framework returns OK/NOT OK for individual tests and PASS/FAIL for a test suite. This may not capture the nuances of the Grid Cert Profile or other docs.
